Intro
------
This is a small script which fetches comments from Reddit, feeds them into a Markov chain, and then periodically generates comments from the chain, which it pushes onto an Identica [page](http://identi.ca/redditbot/all).

Notes
------

* This script uses my Python wrapper for the Reddit API, which can be found on my github page.
* This script also uses the Tweepy Python module.
* This is a conceptual copy of chromakode's [redditron](http://github.com/chromakode/redditron). I created it primarily for fun, and also to demonstrate how easy it is to develop scripts/apps using Reddit content using my Reddit API wrapper.
