Intro
------
This is a small script which fetches comments from Reddit, feeds them into a Markov chain, and then periodically generates comments from the chain, which it pushes onto an Identica [page](http://identi.ca/redditbot/all).

Notes
------

* This script uses mellort's for the Reddit API, which can be found on [his github page](https://github.com/mellort).
* This script also uses the Tweepy Python module.
* This is a conceptual copy of chromakode's [redditron](http://github.com/chromakode/redditron). Mellort created it primarily for fun, and also to demonstrate how easy it is to develop scripts/apps using Reddit content using his Reddit API wrapper.
